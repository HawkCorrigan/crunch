Very fun re-exploration of C++ to gather data from the Warcraftlogs v2 API to compute useful approximations of class behaviours.
A lot of this code will look REALLY stupid and like I'm reinventing the wheel. Shut up.

If you want to use the very questionable python warcraftlogs v2 api script, you must supply your own v2 api credentials.
Check out commit 8a2b4f7 to see an example. Those credentials have been invalidated since that commit.
